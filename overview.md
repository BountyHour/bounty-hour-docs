# Bounty Hour

## What is it?

Bounty Hour is a microcontracting marketplace, based on the "bug bounty" system. Development teams who are unable to solve a issue and require a specialist can submit a bounty, and specialists can pick it up. The bounty is only paid out when (or if) the work is completed, and may be attempted by multiple specialists. Each specialist only has 24hr to complete a bounty, after which it is freed up for another.

This system ensures development teams only pay when their problem is solved, whilst also providing an incentive for bounty hunters to complete tasks as efficiently as possible. 

Hunting bounties is not intended as a full time job, or even a major income, but as a side hustle for software engineers with extra capacity.

## Targeted vision

### Developers

The vast majority of your job is probably building large new features or tidying up code. You might go entire weeks without actually doing anything new or challenging yourself.

Why not spend an hour of your time to do something challenging, and get paid extra for it?

### Managers

Got a problem that's been plaguing you for months, and nobody on the team seems able to solve it? Instead of hiring a contractor for a week and hoping you get lucky, put out a BountyHour. Review experts, choose your requirements, and post. No fix, no fee. 

### Investors / employees

Low risk, as just middleman. Ability to cross-sell / upsell easily to high-wealth individuals.
