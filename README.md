# Bounty Hour

## Elevator pitches / tl;dr

### Developers

The vast majority of your job is probably building large new features or tidying up code. You might go entire weeks without actually doing anything new or challenging yourself.

Why not spend an hour of your time to do something challenging, and get paid extra for it?

### Managers

Got a problem that's been plaguing you for months, and nobody on the team seems able to solve it? Instead of hiring a contractor for a week and hoping you get lucky, put out a BountyHour. Review experts, choose your requirements, and post. No fix, no fee. 

## Features

    * Depends on expertise (FAANG highest, perhaps based on verified email + glassdoor info).
